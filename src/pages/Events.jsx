    <p>Dearly beloved, we assemble here in the presence of 
      God and before this congregation to join together, 
      <em>OLUWATOMISIN RACHEAL OYEWALE and 
      OLUWASEGUN CHARLES ALABA</em> in holy matrimony.
       Marriage is a holy estate instituted by God and 
       commanded in the Scripture as honourable to all who enter it lawfully and 
       in true love. It was confirmed by Christ’s solemn words and hallowed by His gracious
        presence at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee and it is declared by the great 
        apostle Paul as signifying the mystical union between Christ and His church. 
        Therefore, it ought not to be entered into lightly, unadvisedly, but thoughtfully
        , reverently, discreetly, soberly and in the 
       fear of God considering the cause for which it was
        ordained.</p>
        <p>
        <em>First</em> marriage was ordained for companionship, 
        mutual sobriety, help and comfort which husband and 
        wife ought to have for each other in all circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Second,</em>it was ordained for remedy against sin and to 
        avoid fornication, which such persons as have not 
        the gift of celibacy might marry and keep themselves 
        undefiled members of Christ’s body.
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Third, </em>it was ordained for procreation of children according to the will of God, to be brought up in the 
        fear and nurture of the Lord and to the praise of His holy name
        </p>
        <p>
        It is this holy estate that <em>OLUWATOMISIN RACHEAL OYEWALE 
        and OLUWASEGUN CHARLES ALABA</em>have come to be joined. 
        Therefore, if any man can show any just cause why they 
        may not be lawfully joined toget
        her let him now speak or else hereafter 
        forever hold his peace.

    <h2>1.	Hymn of Adoration BH 41 – <em>To God Be the Glory</em> </h2>
    <p>1.	To God be the glory, great things He hath done; 
      So loved He the world that He gave us His Son. 
      Who yielded His life an atonement for sin, 
      And opened the life gate that all may go in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><i>
      Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, 
      Let the earth hear His voice! 
      Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, 
      Let the people rejoice! 
      O come to the Father;
      Thro Jesus the Son, 
      And give Him the glory, 
      Great things He hath done.
      </i>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    2.	O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood
      To ev’ry believer the promise of God;
      The vilest offender who truly believes,
      That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.
    </p>
    <p>
    3.	Great things He hath taught us, great things 
        He hath done, And great our rejoicing thro’ Jesus the Son;  
        But purer, and higher, and greater will be 
        Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see. Amen

     ALABA the vows you are about to make are to be made in the name of the Lord God Almighty with 
     whom we shall have to do, before whom all creatures are made manifest and before whose eyes all 
     things are naked and made open. I require and charge you, as you will answer on the Day of 
     Judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, 
    that if either of you know of any impediment why you may not
     be lawfully joined together in holy matrimony, you confess 
     it now. You know for sure that if any persons are joined 
     together otherwise than as God’s word allows, their
      marriage is not lawful.  
    </p>
    <p>
    GROOM: <em>I</em> do solemnly declare that I do not know of any lawful impediment why
